## Notes/Comments:
- I worked on this project with Rama Ibseileh, and we asked the professor for a shared repository but he didnt create it yet, so we are submitting it separately.
- I used chatgpt to implement a JavaFX GridPane board layout with 40-space Monopoly positioning logic.
- I used chatgpt to generate property ownership and house-building validation system.
- I updated project 2 code to fit the requirements of project 3.
