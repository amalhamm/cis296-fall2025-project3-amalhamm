## Notes/Comments:
-  Amal Hammoud and Rama Ibseileh worked on this project together, and we asked the professor for a shared repository but he didnt create it yet, so we are submitting it from this repository.
- We used some help from chatgpt to implement a JavaFX GridPane board layout with 40-space Monopoly positioning logic.
- We used some help from chatgpt to generate property ownership and house-building validation system.
- We used Amal Hammoud's version for the monopoly game and we updated project 2 code to fit the requirements of project 3.
